The Jupyter Notebooks in this directory are for sharing of Python code
techniques and notes about model results analysis code.
They were developed by Tereza Jarnikova.

The links below are to static renderings of the notebooks via
[nbviewer.jupyter.org](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/).
Descriptions under the links below are from the first cell of the notebooks
(if that cell contains Markdown or raw text).

    **NOTEBOOK CONTENTS**  
      
        -plots of DIC difference (BR-PI run) by month for averaged fields at 0, 20, 50, 100, 200 m  
        -monthly averaged timeseries of DIC values and their differences for the 4 broad subregions  
        -extra DIC by region and depth on one plot  
      
    **Leading questions:**  
      
    **Does the magnitude extra surface DIC vary much by month, depth, & region?**  
          
    **By month:**  
          
        -no interesting pattern in surface, possibly increase in N./C. strait at depth in summer  
          
    **By depth:**  
        -in general, accross all regions, deeper regions have less extra DIC  
        -surface extra DIC is very blotchy ('stochastic')  
       
    **By region:**  
        -N./C. strait have marginally more extra DIC (and more variable) DIC than Haro,   
        - JdF has considerably less extra DIC than the above 3  
          
    **Do we reproduce coastal high-carbon signal, seasonal surface drawdown?**  
      
        -YES! seasonal surface drawdown more pronounced in inner strait than JdF  
        - at depth (50m, 200m, see beautiful upwelling signal)
