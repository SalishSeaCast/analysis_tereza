    "# The inorganic carbon balance and fate of anthropogenic carbon in a temperate fjord system\n",
    "\n",
    "We are trying to write a paper investigating the fate of anthropogenic carbon in a fjord system, using the SalishSeaCast Model, with custom-built carbonate chemistry module, as our tool. The basic idea is to run the SKÃ˜G model in 3 configurations - present-day co2 forcing; preindustrial co2 forcing + present-day boundary conditions; and preindustrial co2 forcing + preindustrial boundary conditions. \n",

    "This notebook tries to keep track of where the model code is, the run files, the results, and all the different bits of analysis are for a) Tereza, who could stand to be more organized, and b) advisors/collaborators - Debby, Susan, etc. The idea is to put links to relatively tidy notebooks that distill what has been done.
